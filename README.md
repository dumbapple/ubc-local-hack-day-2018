This project was developed as part of Major League Hacking's Local Hack Day event hosted by nwHacks at the University of British Columbia.

The team members consisted of Andrew Chang, Kevin Lam, Jason Choi, and Vivian Wu.

Ocean Chat was developed in the hopes of aiding individuals afflicted with depression, anxiety, or other mental illnesses. This chat room is available for those wishing to talk with others regarding their well-being and is an environment to look for support in others going through the same problems.

However, Ocean Chat is not a suitable substitution for any accredited hotline. If you have severe feelings of depression and have suicidal thoughts, please support yourself by interacting with a trained suicide prevention officer.
